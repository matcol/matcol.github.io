## [Board Connections and Competition in Airline Markets](/files/JMP.pdf) (Job Market Paper)

---------

<p class="text-justify">I investigate the effects of board connections on coordination among U.S. legacy airlines. I focus on connections caused by the appointment of an airline director on the board of an intermediate firm. Such connections are unlikely to be related to the airline’s current and future economic prospects. In my baseline specification, I find a reduction of 2.5\% in offered seats when all legacy airlines in a market are board-connected. The effect materializes only in markets where all legacy airlines are connected. Finally, I find that board connections are associated with an average increase of 3.7\% in ticket fares.</p>

## [Credit Conditions when Lenders are Commonly Ownerd](https://lauragrig.github.io/website/ColomboGrigolonTarantinoCreditConditionswhenLendersAreCommonlyOwned.pdf) (with [Laura Grigolon](https://sites.google.com/site/lauragrig/home) and [Emanuele Tarantino](https://sites.google.com/site/etarantino/))

<p class="text-justify">We investigate how common ownership between lenders affects the terms of syndicated loans. We provide a novel view on the role of common ownership in mitigating  information asymmetries on the quality of borrowers and the resulting contractual distortions in the terms of the loan. Our empirical evidence shows that high common ownership decreases loan rates, lowers the share of the loan retained by the lead bank, and mitigates rationing at issuance. Further investigations lend support to the hypothesis that common ownership serves as a device for information transmission: common ownership especially affects the terms of loans for new borrowers, when the lead arranger is likely to hold an informational advantage. As information flows from the lead arranger to syndicate members, we show that member-to-lead and member-to-member common ownership does not affect the terms of syndicated loans.</p>
