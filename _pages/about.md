I am an Assistant Professor of Finance in the Business Economics Department at ESE Rotterdam.

I received my Ph.D. in Finance from the University of Mannheim in September 2023.


**Research interests:**
Corporate Finance, Industrial Organization, Banking

<p class="text-justify">In my research, I examine the relationship between corporate governance and firmsâ€™ strategic interaction. In particular, I investigate how director and ownership networks affect the transmission of information among competing firms and their implications on product market outcomes.</p>
